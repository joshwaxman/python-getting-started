We present here three dictionaries:

<li><a href="./klein/">Klein Dictionary</a> is based on Ernest Klein's <i>A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary Of The Hebrew Language</i>.
Links between headwords are on the basis of semantic similarity.</li>
<li><a href="./clark/">Clark's Dictionary</a> is based on Matityahu Clark's <i>Etymological Dictionary Of Biblical Hebrew</i>.
At the moment, headwords are grouped into phonemic classes and displayed together.</li>
<li><a href="./distributional/">Distributional Dictionary</a> is based on the ETCB dataset, and "roots" are linked by
    distributional criteria.</li>
