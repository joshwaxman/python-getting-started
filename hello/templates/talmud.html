<a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.5b?lang=bi">Pesachim 5b</a></p>
<p><b>Learn from </b> the statement <b>of </b> <b><span class="Tanna" generation="4">Rabbi Akiva</span> </b> <b>three </b> halakhot . <b>Learn from it </b> that <b>the removal of leavened bread </b> can be performed <b>only by </b> means of <b>burning. </b> <span class="Tanna" generation="4">Rabbi Akiva</span> bases his opinion on the fact that it is prohibited to kindle a fire on the Festival. <br> <b>And </b> second, <b>learn from it </b> that the prohibition against kindling a fire on Shabbat <b>was </b> specifically singled <b>out </b> in the Torah <b>to divide </b> the various primary categories of labor and to establish liability for performance of each of them. The dissenting opinion is that kindling is singled out to teach that there is no capital punishment for performing that primary category of labor. <br> <b>And </b> third, <b>learn from it </b> that <b>we do not say: Since </b> it is <b>permitted </b> to <b>kindle </b> a fire <b>for </b> the <b>purpose </b> of preparing food, it is <b>also permitted </b> to light a fire <b>not for </b> the <b>purpose </b> of preparing food, e.g., to burn leaven. </p>
<p><b>The </b> <b>Sages </b> <b>taught </b> in a baraita : <b>`` Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses '' </b> (Exodus 12:19). To <b>what </b> purpose does <b>the verse state </b> this prohibition? <b>Wasnt it already stated: </b> `` And <b>no leaven shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leavened bread seen with you, in all your borders '' </b> (Exodus 13:7)? </p>
<p>The baraita answers: <b>Because it is stated: `` And no leaven shall be seen with you, '' </b> which teaches that <b>your </b> own leaven <b>you </b> may <b>not see, but you may see </b> leaven that belongs <b>to others, </b> i.e., gentiles, <b>and </b> leaven consecrated <b>to God. </b> In light of this halakha , I <b>might </b> have thought that <b>one </b> may <b>conceal </b> leaven in ones home or <b>accept deposits </b> of leaven <b>from a gentile. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: `` Shall not be found, '' </b> meaning that one may not retain any type of leaven in ones house at all. </p>
<p>The tanna continues: Had only this verse been stated, <b>I </b> would <b>have </b> derived <b>nothing other </b> than this halakha <b>with regard to a gentile whom you did not overcome and who does not dwell with you in the courtyard. </b> With regard to <b>a gentile whom you overcame and who dwells with you in the courtyard, from where </b> do we know that he is also included in this prohibition? <b>The verse states: `` It shall not be found in your houses '' </b> at all, i.e., anywhere in ones possession. </p>
<p>The baraita further states that from the verse: `` It shall not be found in your houses, '' <b>I have </b> derived <b>nothing other </b> than the fact that this prohibition applies to leaven <b>that is </b> actually <b>in your houses. From where </b> is it derived that this halakha applies even to leaven <b>in pits, ditches, and caves? The verse states: In all your borders, </b> i.e., anywhere that belongs to you. </p>
<p><b>And still I </b> can <b>say: </b> If there is leaven <b>in your houses, one violates </b> the prohibition that leaven <b>shall not be seen and </b> the prohibition that <b>it shall not be found, as well as </b> the prohibitions of <b>you shall not conceal and you shall not receive deposits from a gentile. </b> Meanwhile, <b>in your borders, </b> outside your home, <b>your </b> own leaven <b>you may not see, but you may see </b> leaven that belongs <b>to others, </b> i.e., gentiles, <b>and </b> leaven consecrated <b>to God. From where </b> is it derived that it is proper <b>to apply </b> the prohibition <b>that was </b> <b>said </b> <b>about this </b> place <b>to that </b> place, <b>and </b> the prohibition <b>that was </b> <b>said </b> <b>about that </b> place <b>to this </b> place? </p>
<p>The tanna answers that <b>the verse states </b> the term <b>leaven </b> with regard to houses and the term <b>leaven </b> with regard to borders <b>as a verbal analogy. It states leaven with regard to houses: </b> `` Seven days <b>leaven shall not be found in your houses, '' and it states leaven with regard to borders: `` Neither shall there be leaven seen with you. '' Just as </b> for the <b>leaven stated with regard to houses one transgresses </b> the prohibition that leaven <b>shall not be seen and </b> the prohibition that <b>it shall not be found, and </b> the prohibitions of <b>one shall not conceal and one shall not receive deposits from a gentile, </b> so <b>too, </b> for the <b>leaven stated with regard to borders, one transgresses </b> the prohibition that leaven <b>shall not be seen and </b> the prohibition that <b>it shall not be found, and </b> the prohibitions of <b>one shall not conceal and one shall not receive deposits from a gentile. </b> </p>
<p>The converse is also true: <b>Just as </b> concerning the <b>leaven stated with regard to borders, your </b> own leaven <b>you may not see, but you may see </b> leaven that belongs <b>to others, </b> i.e., gentiles, <b>and </b> leaven consecrated <b>to God, </b> so <b>too, </b> concerning the <b>leaven stated with regard to houses: Your </b> own leaven <b>you may not see, but you may see </b> leaven that belongs <b>to others and </b> leaven consecrated <b>to God. </b> </p>
<p>The Gemara addresses several difficult aspects of this baraita . <b>The Master </b> <b>said </b> <b>: I </b> would <b>have </b> derived <b>nothing other </b> than this halakha <b>with regard to a gentile whom you did not overcome and who does not dwell with you in the courtyard. </b> With regard to <b>a gentile whom you overcame and who dwells with you in the courtyard, from where </b> is it derived that he is also included in this prohibition? <b>The verse states: `` It shall not be found </b> in your houses. '' </p>
<p>The Gemara questions the logic of this proof. <b>On the contrary; </b> the prohibition regarding the leaven of a gentile who is subservient to and lives with a Jew is more obvious than the prohibition regarding the leaven of a gentile who is neither. The tanna should have started with the leaven belonging to a gentile who is subservient to a Jew . <b><span class="Amora" generation="4">Abaye</span> </b> <b>said </b> <b>: Reverse </b> the order of the statement: I might have thought that only leaven owned by a gentile whom you overcame and who dwells with you in the courtyard is prohibited; but leaven owned by a gentile whom you did not overcome and who does not dwell with you in the courtyard is permitted. </p>
<p><b><span class="Amora" generation="4">Rava</span> </b> <b>said </b> <b>: Actually, do not reverse </b> the order, as this statement is not in fact a continuation of the previous one <b>and </b> instead <b>it applies to the first clause </b> of the baraita , which deals with the time when leaven is permitted. The entire statement should read as follows: <b>Your </b> own leaven <b>you </b> may <b>not see, but you may see </b> leaven that belongs <b>to others, </b> i.e., gentiles, <b>and </b> leaven consecrated <b>to God, </b> as one is not commanded to remove leaven that belongs to a gentile. <b>I have </b> derived <b>nothing other </b> than this halakha <b>with regard to a gentile whom you did not overcome and who does not dwell with you in the courtyard, </b> as the leaven belonging to that gentile is in no way tied to the Jew . With regard to <b>a gentile whom you overcame and who dwells with you in the courtyard, from where </b> is it derived that he is also included in this leniency? <b>The verse states: `` It shall not be found. '' </b> </p>
<p>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This </b> <b>tanna </b> <b>seeks permission </b> for seeing the leaven of a gentile, and yet <b>he cites a verse to </b> establish <b>a prohibition. </b> The Gemara answers that the tanna did not cite proof from the phrase: It shall not be found. <b>Due to </b> the fact <b>that it is stated: </b> `` No leaven shall be seen <b>with you </b> in all your borders '' (Exodus 12:7) and `` No leaven shall be seen <b>with you </b> in all your borders '' ( Deuteronomy 16:4) <b>twice, </b> one of them is superfluous and may be appended to: It shall not be found, creating the prohibition: It shall not be found with you. Only leaven belonging to a Jew is prohibited. </p>
<p>The Gemara continues its analysis of the baraita . <b>The Master </b> <b>said </b> <b>: </b> I <b>might </b> have thought that <b>one </b> may <b>conceal </b> leaven in ones home or <b>accept deposits </b> of leaven <b>from the gentiles. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: It shall not be found. </b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didnt you say in the first clause </b> of the baraita : <b>Your </b> own leaven <b>you may not see, but you may see </b> leaven that belongs <b>to others and </b> leaven consecrated <b>to God, </b> indicating that it is permitted to have leaven in ones house if it belongs to a gentile? </p>
<p>The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; </b> in <b>this </b> case it is prohibited, <b>as he accepted upon himself responsibility </b> to pay for the leaven if it is destroyed. Therefore, it is considered as though the leaven belonged to him. In <b>that </b> case it is permitted, <b>as he did not accept upon himself responsibility, </b> and therefore the leaven remains the full-fledged property of the gentile. </p>
<p>That ruling <b>is like that which </b> <b><span class="Amora" generation="4">Rava</span> </b> <b>said </b> <b>to the residents of </b> <b>Meḥoza </b> <b>: Remove the leavened bread that belongs to the members of the </b> gentile <b>army from your houses. </b> Gentile soldiers would bring flour with them and force the people in the city to prepare bread on their behalf. <span class="Amora" generation="4">Rava</span> explained the rationale for his ruling: <b>Since if </b> the flour <b>were stolen or if it were lost, it stands in your possession and you </b> would be <b>required to pay </b> for it, its legal status <b>is as </b> if it were <b>yours, and it is prohibited </b> to keep it during Passover. </p>
<p>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This </b> explanation works out <b>well according to the one who </b> <b>said </b> <b>: </b> The legal status of <b>an object that effects monetary </b> loss <b>is like </b> that of <b>money. </b> If an item is inherently or currently worthless, but if it is lost or stolen one would be obligated to pay to replace it, its legal status is like that of money. Therefore, the Jews responsibility for the leaven renders its legal status as if it belonged to them. <b>However, according to the one who </b> <b>said </b> <b>: </b> The legal status of an object that effects monetary loss <b>is not like </b> that of <b>money, what can be </b> <b>said </b> <b>? </b> </p>
<p>The Gemara answers: It is <b>different here, as </b> the verse <b>said </b> <b>: `` It shall not be found, '' </b> indicating that leaven may not be found in any place, even if there is only a token connection between the leaven and the Jew in whose property it is situated, and even if he is not required to pay for it if it is lost or stolen. </p>
<p><b>Some state </b> a contrary version of the above discussion. <b>This </b> explanation works out <b>well according to the one who </b> <b>said </b> <b>: </b> The legal status of <b>an object that effects monetary </b> loss <b>is not like </b> that of <b>money. </b> </p>
